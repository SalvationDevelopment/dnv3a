The concatenation of the socket messages defines a (potentially infinite) list
of null-terminated parts, events. (So events can span several messages, even if
they usually do not.)
Each event is a comma-separated list with the first value being the event type.
Commas in the data are escaped as \, backslashes as \\.

List of events:

Legend:

+ = we handle it
ModStatus = 0 for regular users, >0 for mods in increasing order of importance
  I think
LoginToken = token gotten from the login, equal to md5(password)


Outgoing:

+ Connect8,[Username],[LoginToken],[32-byte random hex]

+ Heartbeat -> "Heartbeat" event returned (used for testing disconnects)

* Get deck data -> "Get deck data" event returned

* Private message,[Receiver],[Message]


Ingoing:

+ Connected,[ModStatus?]

+ Heartbeat

+ Global message,Name,Message,(0,1,2,3,4 depending on rank) -> message in global chat

* Timed out -> socket 'close' will come shortly

* Online users,[Name, ModStatus?]*

* Offline users,[Name]*

* Chat unlock -> You can now chat again! (The chat is locked on start and after sending messages.)

* Friends[,Name]*

* Chat error,[Reason, e.g. "Invalid request" which happens on Unicode...]
