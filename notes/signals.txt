The concatenation of the socket messages defined a (potentially infinite) list
of null-terminated parts, events. (So events can span several messages, even if
they usually do not.)
Each event is a comma-separated list with the first value being the event type.
Commas in the data are escaped as \, backslashes as \\.

List of events:


Outgoing:

* Connect6,[Username],[LoginToken],[32-byte random hex]

* Get deck data -> "Get deck data" event returned

* Heartbeat -> heartbeat returned (see frame178)


Ingoing:

* Connected,[Admin?1:0 I think]

* Online users,[Name, Admin?1:0]*

* Offline users,[Name]*

* Chat unlock -> You can use the (global?) chat, I think

* Global message,Name,Message,(0,1,2,3,4 depending on rank) -> message in global chat

* Heartbeat

* Friends[,Name]*
